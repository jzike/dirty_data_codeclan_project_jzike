# Analysis questions

## Q1) What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. 
(Number of candy ratings, not the number of raters. Donâ€™t count missing values)

772,352 candy ratings in total

```{r}
candy_clean %>% 
  #selects ratings
  select(rating) %>% 
  #drops nas so that they're not included in the count
  drop_na(rating) %>% 
  #counts the number of ratings
  summarise(num_ratings = n())
  
```

## Q2) What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating?

Mean age of trick-or-treaters is 35

```{r}
candy_clean %>% 
  select(age, going_out) %>% 
  #filters data to only include those going out
  filter(going_out == "Yes") %>% 
  #drops NAs in the age variable so that mean can be calculated
  drop_na(age) %>% 
  #computes the mean age
  summarise(mean_age_going_out = mean(age))
```


## Q3) What was the average age of people who are not going trick or treating?

Mean age of non trick-or-treaters is 39

```{r}
candy_clean %>% 
  select(age, going_out) %>% 
  #filters data to only those not going out
  filter(going_out == "No") %>% 
  #drops NAs in age so mean can be calculated
  drop_na(age) %>% 
  #calculates the mean age
  summarise(mean_age_staying_in = mean(age))
```


## Q4) For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar received the most of these ratings?

Broken glow stick received the most "despair" ratings
Any full-sized candy bar received the most "joy" ratings
Lollipops received the most "meh" ratings

```{r}
candy_clean %>% 
  select(candy, rating) %>% 
  #groups by ratings and then type of candy
  group_by(rating, candy) %>% 
  #counts the number of ratings for each rating category for each candy
  summarise(num_ratings = n()) %>% 
  #takes the highest rated candy for each rating.
  slice_max(order_by = num_ratings, n = 1)
```


## Q5) How many people rated Starburst as despair?

1990 people rated Starburst as despair.

```{r}
candy_clean %>% 
  select(candy, rating) %>% 
  #filters data to only include Starburst and "despair" ratings
  filter(candy == "Starburst" & rating == "DESPAIR") %>% 
  #counts the number of rows(aka despair ratings)
  summarise(num_despair = n())
```


## Add numeric rating variable for next questions

```{r}
candy_clean <- candy_clean %>% 
  #create a new column for a numeric version of rating
  mutate(rating_numeric = case_when(
    #sets values for despair, joy and meh ratings
    rating == "DESPAIR" ~ -1,
    rating == "JOY" ~ 1,
    rating == "MEH" ~ 0
    #NAs will reach the end and not be assigned a numeric value
  )
  )
```

## Q6) What was the most popular candy bar by this rating system for each gender in the dataset ?

For participants of all genders (male, female and unknown), Any full-sized candy bar was the most popular candy bar.

When full-sized candy bars are discounted:
-Female participants prefer cash
-Male participants prefer Reese's peanut butter cups
-Unknown gender participants prefer cash

Since cash is not a candy bar, female and unknown gender participants were analysed further and after cash, they preferred:
-Female participants - Reese's peanut butter cups
-Unknown gender participants - KitKats

```{r}
candy_clean %>% 
  select(gender, candy, rating_numeric) %>% 
  #drop rows where rating is NA so that they can be summed
  drop_na(rating_numeric) %>% 
  #groups by gender and then candy
  group_by(gender, candy) %>% 
  #sums the numeric rating for each candy by gender
  summarise(sum_rating = sum(rating_numeric)) %>% 
  #takes the top 3 candys and their ratings for each gender
  slice_max(order_by = sum_rating, n = 3)
```



## Q7) What was the most popular candy bar in each year?

For every year, Any full-sized candy bar was the most popular candy bar

When full sized candy bars are discounted:
- Reese's peanut butter cups were most popular in 2015
- Cash was most popular in 2016
- Reese's peanut butter cups were most popular in 2017

Since cash is not a candy bar, 2016 was examined further and KitKat was the most popular.

```{r}
candy_clean %>% 
  select(year, candy, rating_numeric) %>% 
  #drops NAs in numeric rating so sum can be calculated
  drop_na(rating_numeric) %>% 
  #groups by year and then candy
  group_by(year, candy) %>% 
  #sums the numeric ratings for each candy for every year
  summarise(sum_rating = sum(rating_numeric)) %>% 
  #takes the top three candies and their ratings for each year
  slice_max(order_by = sum_rating, n = 3)
```

## Q8) What was the most popular candy bar by this rating for people in US, Canada, UK, and all other countries?

For Canada, the USA and all other countries, Any full-sized candy bar was the most popular candy bar. For the UK, cash was the most popular item. The most popular candy bar was a four-way tie between:
-any full-sized candy bar
-Lindt truffles
-Rolo
-Toblerone

When full-sized candy bars are discounted:
-Americans prefer Reese's peanut butter cups
-Canadians prefer KitKats
-People from any other country prefer cash.

Since cash is not a candy bar, "other country" was further examined and KitKat was the most popular

```{r}
candy_clean %>% 
  select(country, candy, rating_numeric) %>% 
  #drops NAs in numeric rating so sum can be calculated
  drop_na(rating_numeric) %>% 
  #groups by country and then candy
  group_by(country, candy) %>% 
  #takes the sum of numeric ratings for each candy for each country
  summarise(sum_rating = sum(rating_numeric)) %>% 
  #takes the top 3 candies and their ratings for each year.
  slice_max(order_by = sum_rating, n = 3)
```
