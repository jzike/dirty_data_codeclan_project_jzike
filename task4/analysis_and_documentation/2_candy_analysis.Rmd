  slice_max(order_by = num_ratings, n = 1)
```

```


## Add numeric rating variable for next questions

```{r}
candy_clean <- candy_clean %>% 
  mutate(rating_numeric = case_when(
    rating == "DESPAIR" ~ -1,
    rating == "JOY" ~ 1,
    rating == "MEH" ~ 0
  )
  )
```

## Q6) What was the most popular candy bar by this rating system for each gender in the dataset ?

-Unknown gender participants prefer cash

Since cash is not a candy bar, female and unknown gender participants were analysed further and after cash, they preferred:
-Female participants - Reese's peanut butter cups
-Unknown gender participants - KitKats

```{r}
candy_clean %>% 
  select(gender, candy, rating_numeric) %>% 
  drop_na(rating_numeric) %>% 
  group_by(gender, candy) %>% 
  summarise(sum_rating = sum(rating_numeric)) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = sum_rating, n = 3)
```

Since cash is not a candy bar, 2016 was examined further and KitKat was the most popular.

```{r}
candy_clean %>% 
  select(year, candy, rating_numeric) %>% 
  drop_na(rating_numeric) %>% 
  group_by(year, candy) %>% 
  summarise(sum_rating = sum(rating_numeric)) %>%

```

```{r}
candy_clean %>% 
  select(country, candy, rating_numeric) %>% 
  drop_na(rating_numeric) %>%
